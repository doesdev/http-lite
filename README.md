> A minimalistic take on Node's `http` module

# Exercise is done, there be nothing useful here. Use `http`

Right now this is copy paste of the built-in http lib, with some extremely minor
changes. There's no compelling reason to use this over the standard lib. It's
more an exercise than anything.

At present it is up to date with commit #51be03c on master. The only changes are
removal of debug calls, a few tiny semantic tweaks (changes in if order sort of
stuff), and using `standard-js`. In the included benchmarks it does run
consistently more reqs/sec, though not enough to matter. Last bench I ran was
49k over 46k.

Such minor gains are worthless unmatched with the tests, community and ongoing
development of the standard library. So just don't use this. If I find any
real gains in this exercise I'll certainly point them upstream.
